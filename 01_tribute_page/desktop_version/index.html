         <p1>Early life</p>
         <p2>Irving was born John Wallace Blunt, Jr. in Exeter, New Hampshire, the son of Helen Frances (née Winslow) and John Wallace Blunt, Sr., a writer and executive recruiter;[3][4] the couple parted during pregnancy.[5] Irving grew up in Exeter, as the stepson of a Phillips Exeter Academy faculty member, Colin Franklin Newell Irving, and nephew of another, H. Hamilton "Hammy" Bissell (1929). Irving was in the Phillips Exeter wrestling program both as a student athlete and as an assistant coach, and wrestling features prominently in his books, stories, and life. Irving's biological father, whom he never met–even if the latter was, from time to time and on purpose, attending his son's wrestling competitions–,[5] had been a pilot in the Army Air Forces and during World War II was shot down over Burma in July 1943,[6] but survived (an incident incorporated into the novel The Cider House Rules). Irving did not find out about his father's heroism until 1981.[7]<p2>

        <p3>Personal life</p3></br>
        <p4>In 1964, Irving married Shyla Leary,[25] whom he had met at Harvard in 1963 while taking a summer course in German, before traveling to Vienna, Austria with IES Abroad.[26] They had two sons, Colin and Brendan,[27] and divorced in the early 1980s.[28] In 1987, he married Janet Turnbull, who had been his publisher at Bantam-Seal Books[28][29] and is now one of his literary agents.[30] They have a son, Everett.[28] Irving has homes in Vermont, Toronto, and Pointe au Baril.[28][29]

Irving was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2007 and subsequently had a radical prostatectomy.[28]

In 2010, Irving confirmed that he is a second cousin of Amy Bishop, an assistant professor at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, who is serving a life sentence for shooting six colleagues, killing three, during a department meeting on February 12 of the same year.[31]</p4>
